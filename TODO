* setup keyring/keychain for ssh keys, whatever that entails (unneccessary with gnome3?)
* vim plugins/setup fixed
    * neovim now setup, but not complete with all plugins
    * vim should be cleaned up a little bit more, but is in maintenance mode
* fix pushd/popd in zshrc, I'm not sure how I want this to work yet
