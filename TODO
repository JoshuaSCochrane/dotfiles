* fix pushd/popd in zshrc, I'm not sure how I want this to work yet
* debian stable probably won't be supported until the kernel is >=4.13 due to a
  bug in the overlay2 filesystem and instead you can use aufs which is also
  buggy, so I probably won't even bother until then.
* I don't know if it makes sense to use this repo on a server as opposed to a
  workstation, I'll probably figure that out when my SOHO server arrives.
* install rustup and rust, I would like to start using rust as a tech demo
* install go, I don't have any current plans to learn go, although this might be fun
