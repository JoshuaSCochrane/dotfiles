fix xmodmap, right now xmodmap commands are in .bashrc. This causes them to be
run every time the terminal is started, which errors, they should only be run
at user logon see next item

.profile should run at user logon, it doesn't seem to be working fix this.

finally, setup keyring/keychain for ssh keys, whatever that entails
