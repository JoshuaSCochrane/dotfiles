WARNING:
This script will permanently delete ~/.vim/, ~/.vimrc, and ~/.bashrc. Back
these up before beginning.

To use:
chmod a+x run.sh
./run.sh [commands]

Current commands supported:
xfce4

No other files need chmod from the user.

First this set of scripts installs software to your machine. install.sh is the
first script to run followed by each install_[command].sh. You can add your own
commands by simply adding the install_[command].sh file. 

Next the setup.sh script is run. This is for generic setup commands that do not
involve installing software. Next each setup_[command].sh script is run. You
can add your own commands by simply adding the setup_[command].sh file. 

You do not need to add both the install_[command].sh and the setup_[command].sh
files. If one or both do not exist, even though the command was supplied at the
command line, it will be skipped.

Next, the dotfiles.sh script runs, which sets up dotfiles in your home 
directory. The files placed in your home directory are symlinks to the 
actual dotfiles stored in ./dotfiles/.
